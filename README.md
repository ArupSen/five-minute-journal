### 5 Minute Journal

Having read about the five minute journal rather than just getting the physical book or the mobile app, I thought that it would make a nice personal programming project for me and I could also tweak it a little to suit my own needs. I am going to be implementing this using ruby and storing journal pages as csv files.

- text based command line program
- shows a random daily quote persistent for that day (as file is updated)
- daily quote remains visible while user input occurs
- quotes come from a csv file
- prompts user for entries to each section
- date is auto filled
- each day is logged as a csv file
- daily quote is added to that days file
- displays what has been added to that days file while prompting for new input
